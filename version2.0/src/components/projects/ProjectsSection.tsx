    Combines retro game design with cutting-edge AI, where the recreated environment enables a model to learn strategies and optimize gameplay performance, navigating through levels and overcoming obstacles as an AI agent learns progressively from its interactions.
    
    Both a homage to one of my favorite games and a fun experimental learning tool for reinforcement learning techniques.`,
